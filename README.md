A BitTorrent library written in Ruby.

For a simple example to get started see lib/download.rb

The library supports seeding and downloading but does not yet support any extensions e.g. DHT or Fast.

Next steps:

* Package as a gem
* Add support for Fast extension
* Add request pipelining for greater download speed
* Explicit support for parallel activity across multiple torrents
